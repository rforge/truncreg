Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o Added/improved support for standard extractor methods:
    logLik(), model.matrix(), model.frame(), terms(), predict().
  
  o Extended information provided in "truncreg" objects to
    support methods above, e.g., the terms and number of
    observations are now conveniently accessible, model/y/x
    are optionally available.
    
  o Added internal check that the response is actually truncated
    and an error is thrown if not.
